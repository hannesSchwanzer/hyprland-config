# Hyprland Config
This is my custom hyprland config. A lot of the files were copied / modified / inspired from [omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy)

## Installation
```sh
eval "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hannesSchwanzer/hyprland-config/refs/heads/main/install-directly.sh)"
```
